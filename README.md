# Tableau-COVID-19-Time-Series-Data-Visualizations
 Tableau data visualizations for COVID-19 cases in East-Asia and Southeast Asia.
 
I explored the Tableau COVID-19 dataset for East-Asia and Southeast Asia to compare and contrast the rates of the spread of the virus in different countries.

My visualizations will help answer the following questions:
(1) Which Asian countries had the highest/lowest number of cases?
(2) Do wealthier, more developed countries have a greater or fewer number of cases?
(3) Do poorer, less developed countries have a significantly greater number of deaths per case?
